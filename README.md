# Neural network and perceptron
This is course work for TDT4171 where we are supposed to implement both a perceptron and a neural network. 
We are going to classify wheter a cell is malignant or not using the ´data/breastcancer.p´ dataset

### Perceptron 
The perceptron is implemented in `neural_network_perceptron.py´. It consists only of the input layer and its weights to the output node. 
Still it gets a high accuracy of at least 0.8. 
Passes the test ✔️

### Neural network
The neural network only consists of one hidden layer with 25 nodes. 
The network is ´neural_network_hidden_layer.py´

Passes the test (sometimes) ✔️
