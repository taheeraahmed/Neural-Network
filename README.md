# Neural network and perceptron
This is course work for TDT4171 where we are supposed to implement both a perceptron and a neural network. 
We are going to classify wheter a cell is malignant or not using the ´data/breastcancer.p´ dataset

### Perceptron 
Passes the test ✔️

### Neural network
The neural network only consists of one hidden layer with 25 nodes. 
Passes the test (sometimes) ✔️
