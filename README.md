# Neural network and perceptron
This is course work for TDT4171 where we are supposed to implement both a perceptron and a neural network. 
We are going to classify wheter a cell is malignant or not using the <code>data/breastcancer.p</code> dataset

### Perceptron 
The perceptron is implemented in <code>neural_network_perceptron.py</code>. It consists only of the input layer and its weights to the output node. 
Still it gets a high accuracy of at least 0.8. 
Passes the test ✔️

### Neural network
This neural network consists of one input layer, one hidden layer with 25 nodes and an output layer. 
The network is <code>neural_network_hidden_layer.py</code> and gets an accuracy of at least 0.8 as well. 

Passes the test ✔️
